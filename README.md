- **Microsoft 365 subscription** with access to security features.
- **Azure subscription** for Microsoft Sentinel.
- Basic understanding of cybersecurity principles.

### Installation

1. **Sign up for Microsoft 365 and Azure**:
   - [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365)
   - [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)

   az login

## Microsoft Sentinel

### KQL

**Kusto Query Language (KQL)** is the primary query language for Microsoft Sentinel, it is a powerful querying language for querying data and systems in your environment and can be used in Threat Hunting capabilities or to create detection rules.

### Threat Hunting
**Threat hunting** in Microsoft Sentinel involves proactively searching through logs and data for suspicious activities. Here's how you can start:

- Identify Hypotheses: Based on known threats or anomalies.
- Use KQL: Write queries to search for indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Analyze Results: Look for patterns or anomalies.
- Take Action: Respond to any identified threats.

## Microsoft Defender

### Defender for Endpoint

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides advanced threat protection for endpoints. Key features include:

- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Detect, investigate, and respond to threats.
- **Threat & Vulnerability Management:** Identify and remediate vulnerabilities.

#### Setup Guide

**Onboard Devices:**

- Use Group Policy or Intune for Windows devices.
- Deploy configuration profiles for macOS and Linux.

**Configure Alerts:**

- Set up alert notifications in the Defender portal.

**Automate Responses:**

- Use automated investigations to remediate threats.

### Defender for Identity

Defender for Identity helps protect your Active Directory from advanced attacks. Here's how to get started:

- **Install Sensors:** Deploy sensors on domain controllers.
- **Configure Alerts:** Customize alerts for suspicious activities.
- **Monitor Identity Activities:** Use the Defender for Identity dashboard.

### Defender for Cloud

Microsoft Defender for Cloud (formerly Azure Security Center) provides unified security management and threat protection. Key steps:

- **Enable Defender Plans:** Activate relevant security plans for your resources.
- **Implement Security Recommendations:** Follow guidance to secure your cloud infrastructure.
- **Respond to Alerts:** Use the Security Alerts page to investigate incidents.

### Advanced Threat Protection

Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is an integral part of Microsoftâ€™s security offerings. Here's a quick guide:

- **Enable ATP:** Configure ATP settings in Microsoft 365 Admin Center.
- **Analyze Threats:** Use threat intelligence to understand attacks.
- **Implement Policies:** Create policies for email protection, safe links, and safe attachments.
