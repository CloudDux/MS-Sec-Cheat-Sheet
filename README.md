## Introduction

Microsoft's security suite offers a range of tools and capabilities designed to help you protect your organization from threats, detect vulnerabilities, and respond to incidents effectively. This guide provides you with the resources you need to get the most out of these tools, whether you're a beginner or an experienced security professional.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Microsoft 365 subscription** with access to security features.
- **Azure subscription** for Microsoft Sentinel.
- Basic understanding of cybersecurity principles.

### Installation

1. **Sign up for Microsoft 365 and Azure**:
   - [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365)
   - [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)

2. **Access Microsoft Security Tools**:
   - **Microsoft Sentinel**: Enable in your Azure portal.
   - **Microsoft Defender**: Configure through the Microsoft 365 Security Center.

3. **Install Azure CLI (optional)**:

   ```bash
   curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
   az login

## Microsoft Sentinel

### KQL

**Kusto Query Language (KQL)** is the primary query language for Microsoft Sentinel, it is a powerful querying language for querying data and systems in your environment and can be used in Threat Hunting capabilities or to create detection rules.

### Threat Hunting
**Threat hunting** in Microsoft Sentinel involves proactively searching through logs and data for suspicious activities. Here's how you can start:

- Identify Hypotheses: Based on known threats or anomalies.
- Use KQL: Write queries to search for indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Analyze Results: Look for patterns or anomalies.
- Take Action: Respond to any identified threats.

## Microsoft Defender

### Defender for Endpoint

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides advanced threat protection for endpoints. Key features include:

- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Detect, investigate, and respond to threats.
- **Threat & Vulnerability Management:** Identify and remediate vulnerabilities.

#### Setup Guide

**Onboard Devices:**

- Use Group Policy or Intune for Windows devices.
- Deploy configuration profiles for macOS and Linux.

**Configure Alerts:**

- Set up alert notifications in the Defender portal.

**Automate Responses:**

- Use automated investigations to remediate threats.

### Defender for Identity

Defender for Identity helps protect your Active Directory from advanced attacks. Here's how to get started:

- **Install Sensors:** Deploy sensors on domain controllers.
- **Configure Alerts:** Customize alerts for suspicious activities.
- **Monitor Identity Activities:** Use the Defender for Identity dashboard.

### Defender for Cloud

Microsoft Defender for Cloud (formerly Azure Security Center) provides unified security management and threat protection. Key steps:

- **Enable Defender Plans:** Activate relevant security plans for your resources.
- **Implement Security Recommendations:** Follow guidance to secure your cloud infrastructure.
- **Respond to Alerts:** Use the Security Alerts page to investigate incidents.

### Advanced Threat Protection

Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is an integral part of Microsoftâ€™s security offerings. Here's a quick guide:

- **Enable ATP:** Configure ATP settings in Microsoft 365 Admin Center.
- **Analyze Threats:** Use threat intelligence to understand attacks.
- **Implement Policies:** Create policies for email protection, safe links, and safe attachments.

## DFIR / IR Best Practices

Effective Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) is crucial for handling and mitigating security incidents. Here are some best practices to consider:

### Incident Response Process

1. **Preparation**
   - Develop and maintain an incident response plan.
   - Conduct regular training and simulations for the response team.
   - Ensure all team members have clear roles and responsibilities.

2. **Identification**
   - Monitor systems and networks for suspicious activities.
   - Use tools to detect anomalies, intrusions, or unauthorized access.
   - Verify and classify potential incidents based on severity and impact.

3. **Containment**
   - Implement measures to prevent further damage and spread of the threat.
   - Use network segmentation and isolation techniques.
   - Preserve evidence for further analysis.

4. **Eradication**
   - Identify the root cause of the incident.
   - Remove malicious artifacts and apply necessary patches.
   - Strengthen security measures to prevent recurrence.

5. **Recovery**
   - Restore affected systems and services to normal operation.
   - Validate systems for integrity and functionality.
   - Monitor for signs of weakness or further attacks.

6. **Lessons Learned**
   - Conduct a post-incident review to analyze the response.
   - Document findings and update the incident response plan.
   - Improve processes based on lessons learned.

### DFIR Best Practices

- **Evidence Handling**
  - Follow strict chain-of-custody procedures for evidence integrity.
  - Use forensic tools to capture and analyze data without altering it.
  - Secure physical and digital evidence storage.

- **Communication**
  - Maintain clear communication with all stakeholders during incidents.
  - Provide timely updates on incident status and response efforts.
  - Coordinate with external entities like law enforcement if needed.

- **Threat Intelligence**
  - Integrate threat intelligence into the incident response process.
  - Use intelligence to anticipate threats and enhance defenses.
  - Share intelligence with trusted partners and communities.

- **Documentation**
  - Keep detailed records of all actions and decisions during incidents.
  - Use standardized forms and templates for consistent reporting.
  - Ensure documentation is accessible for future reference and audits.

- **Continuous Improvement**
  - Regularly review and update incident response procedures.
  - Conduct after-action reviews and implement feedback.
  - Stay informed about emerging threats and DFIR techniques.

## Security Best Practices

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA for all users.
- **Conditional Access:** Use conditional access policies to secure access.
- **Regular Audits:** Conduct security audits to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Patch Management:** Keep systems up-to-date with the latest patches.
- **Employee Training:** Educate employees on security awareness.
